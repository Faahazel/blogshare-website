    <p><B>Hi and Assalamualaikum, welcome to our blog, peeps!</B></p>
    <p>I'm Fatin Nurhazirah Zamzury, you guys can call me either Fatin or Hazirah
        as long as it's still my name, that's not a problem for me. Here I would love to share a little bit 
        about myself, even though there is actually no uniqueness about me. But, I love myself,
        and I'm happy to share my humble biography. I'm 20 and was born in Kuala Terengganu,
        but currently I'm staying at Johor to follow my family that has lived there since I was little.
        Besides, I'm the third of four siblings and I'm the only daughter in the family.
        Some people said that only daughter are lucky, for me, yes, because I got everything without
        mind to share it with my other siblings. I don't know how to describe myself; what can I say
        that I'm fragile and complicated. That is all the information about myselfthat i able to share.
        Without further ado, enjoy the blogs guys!
    </p>

    <P><B>PERPUSTAKAAN TUN SRI LANANG</B></P>
    <p>Perpustakaan Tun Sri Lanang or well-known as PTSL is very famous places
        among "bookworm" students. This library has a huge longitude and latitude that provide 
        many facilities such as cyber center, a study room, and more that are suitable
        for students to have a group discussion or review their studies. Besides, they
        also provide many study references, and it quite easy to search all the 
        reference sources because they are already arranged according to their genre
        and type codes. And to make it easier, the library already has a system that can help
        users find their reading sources.

    <p><b>HOT MEAL BAR UKM</b></p>
    <p>The Hot Meal Bar restaurant is the most hectic and crowded place in UKM,
        especially during the peak hours. This restaurant serves Chinese cuisine,
        and the most popular meal there is beef mee tarik and dumplings. The price
        is quite affordable for the portion they serve. I highly recommend This
        place to those who are currently craving the Chinese cuisine.

    <P><b>HUTAN SIMPAN UKM</b></P>
    <P>Hutan Simpan UKM is one of the best place in UKM for those who are currently
        in UKM and wanting to hiking, go and try it. We already go up and reach the peak and then 
        go down less than 10 minutes. That's mean it not really high to achieve the peak.

        <p>Quick share my experience through this first semester:</p>
        <figure><img src="qq.jpg" alt="us" width="500" height="300"></figure>

       <p><li>My first week in UKM was a bit chaotic at first because there were
            too many things I should settle on at once while the class had already
            started, but everything went smoothly and fun after I managed to make friends
            with two first persons when I was starting my journey in UKM. Those 
            two lucky people are my own blog mates, Yasmin and Vinoo. We enjoyed our
            first week of learning in UKM, even though it was still done online.
