    <p><B>Hi and Assalamualaikum, welcome to our blog peeps!</B></p>
    <p>I'm Fatin Nurhazirah Zamzury, you guys can call me either Fatin or Hazirah
        as long as it's still my name, that's not a problem for me. Here I would love to share a little bit 
        about myself, even though there is actually no uniqueness about me. But, I love myself,
        and I'm happy to share my humble biography. I'm 20 and was born in Kuala Terengganu,
        but currently I'm staying at Johor to follow my family that has lived there since I was little.
        Besides, I'm the third of four siblings and I'm the only daughter in the family.
        Some people said that only daughter are lucky, for me, yes, because I got everything without
        mind to share it with my other siblings. I don't know how to describe myself; what can I say
        that I'm fragile and complicated. That is all the information about myselfthat i able to share.
        Without further ado, enjoy the blogs guys!

    <P><B>PERPUSTAKAAN TUN SRI LANANG</B></P>
    <p>Perpustakaan Tun Sri Lanang or well-known as PTSL is very famous places
        among "bookworm" students. This library has a huge longitude and latitude that provide 
        many facilities such as cyber center, a study room, and more that are suitable
        for students to have a group discussion or review their studies. Besides, they
        also provide many study references, and it quite easy to search all the 
        reference sources because they are already arranged according to their genre
        and type codes. And to make it easier, the library already has a system that can help
        users find their reading sources.

    <p><b>HOT MEAL BAR UKM</b></p>
    <p>The Hot Meal Bar restaurant is the most hectic and crowded place in UKM,
        especially during the peak hours. This restaurant serves Chinese cuisine,
        and the most popular meal there is beef mee tarik and dumplings. The price
        is quite affordable for the portion they serve. I highly recommend This
        place to those who are currently craving the Chinese cuisine.

        <h2>Fatin's share:</h2>
       <p><li>My first week in UKM was a bit chaotic at first because there were
            too many things I should settle on at once while the class had already
            started, but everything went smoothly and fun after I managed to make friends
            with two first persons when I was starting my journey in UKM. Those 
            two lucky people are my own blog mates, Yasmin and Vinoo. We enjoyed our
            first week of learning in UKM, even though it was still done online.
        </li></p>
        <p><li>I'm effectively registered as a UKM student at the end of March, which
            falls in the month of fasting. It was very hectic yet fun because, during the same
            time I was busy with class and registering for CITRA courses, I also took
            the opportunity to go food hunting for iftar around cafes in UKM. I've already
            tried certain meals from cafes around UKM. Everything is delicious and very 
            affordable for students. My favourite meals are from KPZ. I love KPZ's meals
            even though I'm Highlanders.
