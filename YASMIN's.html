    <p>Assalamualaikum and hi welcome to our blog!!
On this part, I will be sharing about myself. I am thrilled to have this opportunity to introduce myself to you. As I embark on this blogging journey, I believe it is important to establish a personal connection and give you a glimpse into the person behind the words on your screen. So, without further ado, allow me to introduce myself. 
</P>

<p>
About me: 
</p>
<p>
My name is Yasmin Qistina. I am 22 years old and I am from Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. I have 4 siblings which including 2 older brother and 1 younger brother. Yup, I am the only girl among my siblings. I am glad that I have a lovely and supportive family.
 
</p>

<p>
Next, I’m going to share my study background, I graduate from Diploma in Business Studies. Now I am pursuing my degree in Bachelor of Business Administration at the National University of Malaysia. I really enjoy taking this course. The feeling of excitement I have, which I am excited to attend lectures, participate in discussions, and discover new ideas. I am motivated by the good energy I get from anticipating learning new things. The surrounding and all new people and friends I met was one of the reasons I enjoy taking this course.

<p>
I am with my parents, driving me all the way from Cheras heading to Kolej Ibrahim Yaakub where it’s the college that I’ve been registered for. After settling down all the registration things with the admin of the college, then I move in to my lovely second room hehe :)

Then, the chance to interact with other fresh students was one of the joys of my first week. I started up talks with students from all backgrounds in lecture halls, common areas, and at events and learned about our mutual interests. Bonds started forming that would later serve as the basis of lifelong friendships because of the anxiety we all had and the thrill of starting this new chapter together. It was really exciting to have all new friends which came from different states. My roommate is from Johor, lucky me to have a roommate that taking the same course as me.  
</P>

<p>
As my intake does not have any orientation week, but still, I manage to explore where the universities facilities, all the faculties, office management and more around the UKM. I was using one of the useful facilities that UKM provided to their students which is the bus transportation, Kiffah. It was a huge campus that have all the facilities student needs. I can say that I am really grateful being one of student in this university. Also, my college is near with my faculty, and this is the one of benefits to me where I can just walk from my college going to my class. </p>

<p> 
Overall, my first week at university was an emotional roller coaster, but the dominant feeling was one of growth and expectation. Each day brought new knowledge and experiences, from navigating the campus to making friends, from understanding academic requirements to exploring extracurricular activities. I am excited for the years ahead and all the possibilities waiting ahead as I look back on this life-changing week. It has been an amazing adventure to start this academic path, and I can't wait to see where it leads me next. </P>

On this part, I wanted to share to you guys about my recently hiking trip to Rawang Bypass. As I know, Rawang Bypass is Malaysia’s Tallest Highway. I went there with my uni friends. We went to hiking there on weekend, and from Bangi to Rawang, it takes about 1 hour 40 minutes. The entire 2.9 KM standard path will take one between 30 and 40 minutes to complete, and the Rawang Bypass Viewpoint is located at 233 meters above sea level. Here’s the fun fact, this is my very first time going hiking. I was suuuper excited and glad I got the experienced to joining them hiking. </p>

<p>

There are two trails that can lead you to the Rawang Bypass viewpoint. We used the regular trail which is easier plus adventurous and has a view that is much more scenic view. 
After 15 minutes walking followed the hiking trail, there’s a point that we need to walk underneath the elevated highway via a 30 meters long drainage tunnel to get across to other side. </p>

<p>
After crossed the tunnel, we continue the following trail and start hiking in Bukit Matt. We also use the guide ropes when it necessary. Once we reach the Bukit Matt's top, we see the Rawang Bypass viewpoint. I can tell you, the view was really beautiful.
